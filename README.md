# DS-Assignment3

### How much work/ the project scale of assignment3?

#### Heaps
- Max heap with binary tree
- Max heap with D-ary Heap with parameter d(the number of branches) being 4, 6, 8
- A third Heap, may be hard to find, that can be used for priority queue purpose


#### Queue from assignment 1
- Standard Queue/Priority Queue/Half Priority Queue


## Divide project into sub tasks
#### All the sub tasks
- implementing the binary heap with extendable array
- implementing the binary heap with binary tree
- implementing D-ary heap with varying d
- implementing the third heap
- comparison between binary heap with extendable array and binary heap with binary tree
- comparison between binary heap with extendable array and binary heap with binary tree


## Assign sub tasks to team members

- Max heap with binary tree imp, Haopeng
- Max heap with array imp, Prateek
- D-ary Heap imp, Yan
- A third Heap imp, Hong

- experiment Max heap with binary tree imp, the corresponding docs, Haopeng
- experiment Max heap with array imp, the corresponding docs Prateek
- experiment D-ary Heap imp, the corresponding docs Yan
- experiment A third Heap, the corresponding docs Hong

- comparison max heap with tree VS max heap with array, the corresponding docs Prateek
- comparison D-ary heap imp with varying d, the corresponding docs Yan
- standard queue with array from assign1 VS max heap with array, the corresponding docs Haopeng
- priority queue with array from assign1 VS max heap with array, the corresponding docs tuning with another sorting algorithm, Prateek

- video, Haopeng
- final report, Hong lead the team to put the separate parts together
- polish the final report, Prateek





## Decide the deadline for sub tasks

### deadline for all the codes, Friday 24th, 3 days for this
### deadline for the comparisons, experiments, documentations, and ready-to-use sections for the final report, **Tuesday 28th**, 4 days
### deadline for the final report, Wednesday, 29th, need 1 day
### deadline for the review of the report, Friday, 31th, 2 days for this task
